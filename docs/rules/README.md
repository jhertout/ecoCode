Listing of rules applicable to SonarQube tool and easily scannable on a source code.

## Conditions of the applicable rules

An applicable rule must follow these conditions:

- It must be statically detectable
- It must be easily scriptable and return a single response (boolean: TRUE/FALSE)
- It must be validated (by a collective of experts AND/OR by a research thesis or appointed researcher AND/OR by a measurement tool AND/OR by a published article)

## Rules

Web-oriented rules are based on :

- Ecoconception Web / Les 115 bonnes pratiques" book:
(https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices)
- GR491, LE GUIDE DE RÉFÉRENCE DE CONCEPTION RESPONSABLE DE SERVICES NUMÉRIQUES (https://gr491.isit-europe.org/)
- Référentiel général d'écoconception de services numériques (RGESN) (https://ecoresponsable.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/referentiel-general-ecoconception/)

We try to apply these rules to each supported language, so we maintain a matrix to follow current development.
Here are the selected rules currently used on ecoCode
