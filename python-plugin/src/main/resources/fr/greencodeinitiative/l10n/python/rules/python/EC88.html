<p>
    Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. One of its main advantages is its flexibility and dynamic nature. However, this flexibility comes at a cost in terms of performance, especially in memory usage. One way to optimize memory usage is by using the <code>__slots__</code> attribute in class definitions.
</p>

<p>
    By default, when we define a class in Python, it uses a <code>__dict__</code> to store its attributes and methods. This means that every instance of the class has a <strong>dictionary</strong> to store its data, which can be quite memory-intensive.
</p>

<p>
    By using <code>__slots__</code>, we can explicitly declare the data members of the class, allowing Python to allocate memory for each instance of the class more efficiently. When we use <code>__slots__</code>, Python creates a tuple to store the attributes of the class instead of a dictionary, reducing memory usage.
</p>

<p>
    This optimization is especially important for classes that are going to be instantiated multiple times or have a large number of instances, as it can significantly reduce memory consumption. It is also useful when working with large datasets or building memory-intensive applications.
</p>

<p>
    In the case of classes with the <code>@dataclass</code> decorator, which automatically generates boilerplate code for classes, we can also use <code>__slots__</code> to optimize memory usage. By default, <code>@dataclass</code> uses the same <code>__dict__</code> approach for attribute storage. However, by setting the <code>slots</code> parameter to <code>True</code>, we can use the tuple-based attribute storage and reduce memory usage.
</p>

<p>
    Here is the default implementation of the <code>@dataclass</code> decorator:
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        @dataclasses.dataclass(*, init=True, repr=True, eq=True, order=False, unsafe_hash=False, frozen=False, match_args=True, kw_only=False, slots=False, weakref_slot=False)
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    Using <code>__slots__</code> can be an effective way to optimize memory usage in Python classes and improve the performance of memory-intensive applications. It is a minor remediation cost to add <code>__slots__</code> in class definitions and can have significant benefits in terms of memory efficiency.

<pre>
    <code>
        # Non-compliant
        class MyClass:
            def __init__(self, a, b, c):
                self.a = a
                self.b = b
                self.c = c

        # Compliant
        class MySlottedClass:
            __slots__ = ('a', 'b', 'c')
            def __init__(self, a, b, c):
                self.a = a
                self.b = b
                self.c = c

        # Compliant
        @dataclass(slots=True)
        class MyDataClassSlottedClass:
            a: int
            b: int
            c: int
    </code>
